1.Can you explain the concept of object-oriented programming in Java?
A.
Sample answer
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. In Java, OOP is an essential part of the language. Some key concepts of OOP in Java include: 1. Classes and objects: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are instances of a class, representing real-world entities. 2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation allows the bundling of data and methods together, hiding the internal details of an object and providing a clean interface for interacting with the object. It helps maintain data integrity and code modularity. 3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, enabling code reuse and promoting the concept of hierarchy. 4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. 5. Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It helps in managing complexity and improving code maintainability. By applying these principles of OOP in Java, developers can create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

How would you integrate Git into your development workflow?
A.
Sample answer
Git is a widely used distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing the changes to the source code. Integrating Git into the development workflow involves several steps: 1. Initializing a Git repository: Start by creating a new Git repository or cloning an existing repository. 2. Creating branches: Use branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Create a branch for each feature or task and switch between branches as needed. 3. Committing changes: Regularly commit your changes to create checkpoints in the development process. Write descriptive commit messages to track the changes made. 4. Pushing and pulling changes: Push your local changes to the remote repository to share them with other developers. Pull changes from the remote repository to get the latest changes made by others. 5. Resolving conflicts: When two developers make conflicting changes to the same file, Git will show a merge conflict. Resolve the conflict by manually editing the file and then commit the changes. 6. Reviewing changes: Use pull requests to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase. Collaborate with other developers to ensure that the changes are reviewed thoroughly. By following these steps and leveraging the features of Git, developers can effectively collaborate, track changes, and manage the development process in a distributed team environment.
